Computer Numerical Control (CNC) is a manufacturing process in which pre-programmed computer software observes the movement of factory tools and machinery. This process can be used to control a range of complex machinery, from CNC routers. The electric current drawn by the spindle motor is a critical parameter to monitor. It provides insights into the load and conditions under which the motor operates. By analyzing this current, you can assess various aspects of machine tool performance. To analyze the current of the spindle motor, you can follow these steps:
